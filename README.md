Problem Statement:  
In 2019 survey crime rate in India was estimated to be around 51lakhs. Almost 100 thousand cases were reported only from one single city that is Delhi our capital city. The growth ratio of crime rate from 2012 to 2019 is almost 35 percent. The main reason for this rapid growth in the crime rates in India is because many crime makers are uncaught and are roaming around freely and this gives the newbies a great amount of confidence.
Solution:
The only solution to stop the issue is to make the citizens know what’s exactly happening in our country and make them aware of the crimes happening in their area. The pressure for the area inspector will be given not from his higher authorities but from the normal public and everyone can have peaceful life and a safe environment.
Proposed Solution:
Now, almost all the streets in the cities have cctv camera installed by the government, but they are used for manual verification. We intend to use the existing resource (cctv in the streets) to predict the crime. How do we exactly do it?
Easyocr techniques have been used to track down the number plates of the vehicles and to check it with the police database to verify if it is a robbed vehicle or a vehicle used for a crime to be executed.
The cctv in the streets normally records the footage until it finds a dangerous object such as gun or something, the moment it identifies something an intimation will be sent to the nearest police station once the police verify and confirms the crime and the crime gets updated in the map which will be viewed by the public. When an area is selected by the public all the crimes happened in that area can be viewed.
We have used LSTM as an additional layer in CNN to detect kidnaps and confirm the kidnap by sending the kidnap recognised footage to the police portal that we’ve created. If the kidnap is confirmed, it gets updated in the map.
Other kind of crimes are trained using CNN which follows the same strategy of 2nd level human verification and then updating in google maps as it also intimates the traveller about the upcoming most crime occurring place. 
We have also used “Triangulation method”, tracing down the of the criminals are also equally important, this method uses communication between the cameras. The recognized frame that has been sent to the police is sent to the cameras of 2km in radius of tracing. This helps in tracing the criminal without using a physical GPS module

Conclusion:
This gives a better awareness to the public about what’s happening in the country, this also gives the police a greater chance to catch the crime maker immediately and with great ease.
